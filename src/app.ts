To understand how the application works, I suggest you visit my GitHub page (until I find the time to upload the complete Swagger documentation here). Itâ€™s essentially a backend for a blog where users can create their accounts, create blogs, log in, write posts, leave comments on posts, like and dislike posts, and so on. This is a learning project to understand the basics of Express.js with a lot of CRUD operations, DDD architecture, working with MongoDB, authentication, and other features. So if you're interested, you can check out my GitHub and test the routes via Postman.";
