<h1>HiðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my Blog App ðŸš€</h1>
<h3>
    This is a backend application with <span>no frontend</span>. To understand how the application works, I suggest
    you visit my GitHub page (until I find the time to upload the complete Swagger documentation here). Itâ€™s essentially
    a backend for a blog where users can </h3>  <br>
<p>
<h5>
    - create their accounts <br>
    - create blogs <br>
    - log in <br>
    - write posts <br>
    - leave comments on posts <br>
    - like and dislike posts <br>
    - work with JWT tokens <br>
    - access tokens & refresh tokens <br>
    ...and so on. <br> <br> <br>
</h5>
<p>This is a learning application to understand the basics of Express.js with various CRUD operations, DDD architecture, working with MongoDB, business logic, pagination, sorting, CQS/CQRS, and application layers. It includes MongoDB, CRUD operations, asynchronous programming, DataAccessLayer, Middleware, and data validation. The project also covers password hashing with bcrypt and password verification, JWT, HTTP headers, token-based authorization (Bearer token), as well as Nodemailer, SMTP, account registration, and email confirmation. If you're interested, you can check out my GitHub and test the routes via Postman.
